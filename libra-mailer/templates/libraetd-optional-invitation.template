Dear {{.Recipient}},
<p>

Congratulations on the successful completion of your department's pre-thesis requirements. You now have access to <a href="{{.BaseUrl}}">upload your approved thesis to LIBRA</a>.
After you log in to LIBRA, enter the title for your thesis as approved by your department. The title in LIBRA must match the title on record in your school or department or complies with your department's instructions. If it does not, the discrepancy may delay your departmental administrator's ability to verify successful completion of thesis requirements.
<p>

Review the <a href="http://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/etds/etds-checklist/">"Electronic Thesis/Dissertation (ETD) Submission Requirements Checklist"</a> before you upload your thesis files. Please note that uploaded files may not be changed once the submission process is complete.
Text documents deposited in LIBRA must be in PDF format and MUST include the ".pdf" extension. Supplemental files are accepted in most formats. <a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">Contact Libra staff</a> if you have questions about acceptable formats.
Approximately 1 hour after deposit, you may check that your scholarship was successfully added to the Library's collection by searching for your thesis in VIRGO, the UVA online library catalog.
You will receive email confirmation of your deposit, including the permanent URL for your scholarship.

Best Regards,
